# Requirements gathering

Client provided a data model, which was used to Identify datasets required to answer the business question. Write an email to the Associate Director summarising my aproach, requesting client data, and outlining techniques used to investigate client's business question.

## Identified datasets

I've identified Reaction, Content, and Reaction Type as our datasets from the data model. These datasets are going to be used to answer the client's business question: "What are the top 5 popular content categories?"

NB: popularity is quantified by reaction score given to each reaction type.
