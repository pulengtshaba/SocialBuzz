# Data cleaning with Excel

Clean data by:

- Remove rows with missing column values
- Remove columns with irrelevant data types or outliers
- Check for duplicates
- Change data types of some values within a column

## Cleaning process

Firstly I converted(Saved as) the file format from CSV to EXCEL workbook, for easy data transformation. Used excel Filter feature(found in the Data tab) to look through each table columns.

- Content file: fixed duplicates in the content category, e.g "Animal" = Animal by using the replace feature of excel(replaced " with an empty value).
- Reaction Type file: required no cleaning.
- Rections file: found blank entries in the reaction type column using the filter feature, deleted all the blank rows. About 980 rows were lost through this process.
